# ML Competitions

This repository contains my solutions to various machine learning competitions from Kaggle, Topcoder, and other platforms.

## Overview

Machine learning competitions provide a great opportunity to test and improve your skills in data science. They often involve solving real-world problems, working with large datasets, and competing against other data scientists.

This repository includes my solutions to various machine learning competitions. Each competition solution is organized into its own directory, which typically includes the following:

- `data`: A directory containing the raw data for the competition.

- `notebooks`: A directory containing Jupyter notebooks or other scripts used to analyze and model the data.

- `models`: A directory containing any trained machine learning models.

- `submission.csv`: A CSV file containing the final predictions for the competition.


## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you will need to have Python (version 3.7 or higher) and the following libraries installed:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- LightGBM
- TensorFlow

You may also need to install other libraries depending on the competition and the specific techniques used.

## Usage

To use the code in this repository, you can clone the repository to your local machine and navigate to the directory for the competition you are interested in. From there, you can run the Jupyter notebook or other script to reproduce the analysis and generate the final submission.

Each competition directory may also contain additional instructions or notes on the techniques used and the performance achieved.

## Contributing

This repository is intended to showcase my solutions to various machine learning competitions. Contributions and suggestions for improvement are always welcome.
